  ## Process of developing the tool
  During this course, a number of tools and concepts to work with OpenBim has been introduced. It worked well, when the tools were continuously being introduced to, so the students got more familiar working with them. The number of choices were good, and gave us freedom to choose what could be relevant and interesting to work with. 
  The course could be didactic in the beginning with the coding, so it would enable us to go further. It was hard to limit the assignment, and make sure that the task did not become too complex, as an IFC file contains a lot of data.  

  
  
  ## Output of the tool
  The tool achieved the expected result, we were able to get out the information we were aiming. 
  We were able to model the use case, and display the data in a HTML file. 
  We were able to scope the project more clearly, as we learned more about the tools for OpenBim, and learning what was possible. Since we managed to get Speckle to be part of our concept and solution, gives it that advantage that should it be distributed, it will only require one dataset with the thermal values to be maintained. 
  The code should be able to work with other IFC files, however this has not been tested. 
  
  
  ## Future

For future work, our tool could incorporate other building parts, e.g windows, roof, slabs, etc. In this way, the user could get a quick overview of the entire building. 
  Also, after having the list and quantaties of the materials, a LCA calculation could also be done.
  If the concept could be uploaded as an online tool, could it be open for all to use, and share results with the stakeholders of the project. 
  
  In the future work, this approach would give the company value, and save money and time, as the OpenBIM could be a good tool to help investigate and work faster analysing a building project.
