  ## Process of developing the tool
  
  -The course could be didactic in the beginning with the coding, so it would enable us to go further.
  -The number of choices were good, and gave us freedom to choose.
  -The number of tools were good
  
  
  ## Output of the tool
  
  The tool achieved the expected result, we were able to get out the information we were aiming. 
  
  
  ## Future

  - For future work, our tool could incorporate other building parts, e.g windows, roof, slabs, etc. And also, after having the list and quantaties of material could also calculate the LCA.
  The OpenBIM could be a good tool to help investigate and work faster analysing a building project.
